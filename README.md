# Brain-Tumor-Classification

This repository contains a notebook demonstrating the training of a ResNet-50 model on the Kaggle brain tumor dataset: [Brain MRI Images for Brain Tumor Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/navoneel/brain-mri-images-for-brain-tumor-detection).

The model underwent training for 7 epochs and achieved a training accuracy of 94%. Additionally, it was tested on random images downloaded from the internet. The following images illustrate the results:
